# causal_pathway_training
Identify the causality for air pollution in China (North China, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta)
Corresponding to paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07045.

1. Unzip bnt.zip (Matlab Bayesian toolbox) to the main directory.
2. Run zhc_Main.m for training the structure and the parameters of the causality model for air pollution.
3. Result (statistics causal inference: absolute error, accuracy, as well as the intermediate structure infos) was put int the folder ./Result/
