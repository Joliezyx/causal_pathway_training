Corresponding to paper https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pg-Causality-yuzheng.pdf.

1. Unzip bnt.zip (Matlab Bayesian toolbox) to the main directory.
2. Run zhc_Main.m for training the structure and the parameters of the causality model for air pollution.
3. Result (statistics causal inference: absolute error, accuracy, as well as the intermediate structure infos) will be put into the folder ./Result/
